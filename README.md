# Canonical IBL algebra

## About

This [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) notebook implements the structure of an *involutive bi-Lie algebra (IBL)* on cyclic words whose letters are homogenous vectors from a graded vector space equipped with a graded symmetric pairing of degree *n*.

This structure was defined in [Cieliebak, Fukaya, Latschev: Homological algebra related to surfaces with boundary, 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02741).
My implementation is accurate, including the sign.
However, I use the wedge product of cyclic words instead of the symmetric product of degree shifted cyclic words, which induces a consistent sign difference.

Note: I originally published the notebook in [this post](https://p135246.github.io/math/research/2023/04/07/canonical-IBL-algebra.html), which may include some other discussion in the future.
